| Key           | Function                                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| â¬… Left Arrow  | Move the tetromino left.                                       |
| âž¡ Right Arrow | Move the tetromino right.                                      |
| â¬† Up Arrow    | Hard drop (instantly drops the piece to the lowest position).  |
| â¬‡ Down Arrow  | Soft drop (accelerates fall speed while held).                 |
| Z            | Rotate the tetromino counterclockwise.                          |
| X            | Rotate the tetromino clockwise.                                 |
| C            | Hold piece (swap the current tetromino with the hold slot).     |
| Enter        | Pause/Resume the game.                                          |
| Space        | Start a new game (when not running).                            |
| N            | Change song (cycle through embedded MP3s).                      |
| M            | Mute/unmute music.                                              |
